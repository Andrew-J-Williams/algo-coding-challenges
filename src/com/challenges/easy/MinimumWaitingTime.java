/*
 * 
	Minimum Waiting Time
	
	You're given a non-empty array of positive integers representing the amounts of time that specific queries take to execute. Only one query can be executed at a time, but the queries
	can be executed in any order.
	
	A query's 'waiting time' is defined as the amount of time it must wait before its execution can start. In other words, if a query is executed second, then its waiting time is the
	duration of the first query; if a query is executed third, then its waiting time is the sum of the durations of the first two queries.
	
	Write a function that returns the minimum amount of total waiting time for all the queries.
	
	Sample Input:
	[ 3, 2, 1, 2, 6 ]
	
	Sample Output:
	16
