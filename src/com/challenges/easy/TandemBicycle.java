	Tandem Bicycle
	
	A tandem bicycle is a bicycle operated by 2 people: person A and person B. Both people pedal the bicycle, but the person who pedals faster determines the speed of the bicycle. So if
	person A pedals at a speed of '5' and person B pedals at a speed of '4', the tandem bicycle moves at a speed of 5.
	
	You're given two lists of positive integers: one that contains the speeds of the riders wearing red shirts and another that contains the speeds of riders wearing blue shirts. Each rider
	is represented by a single, positive integer, which is the speed they pedal the tandem bike at. Both lists are the same length, meaning there are just as many red shirt riders as there
	are blue shirt riders. Your goal is to pair every rider wearing a red shirt with a rider wearing a blue shirt to operate the tandem bicycle.
